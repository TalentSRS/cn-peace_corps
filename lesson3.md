Mandarin grammar is relatively straightforward. There are no verb conjugations,
no plurals, no articles (a/an/the), and no gender or tenses. At an elementary
level, sentence order is similar to that of English: subject-verb-object. For
example, the sentence “I study Chinese” follows exactly the same word order in
Mandarin:

I study Chinese. Wǒ xué hànyǔ。我学汉语。 (lit: I study Chinese)

Let’s learn a few words first:

    This               zhè       这
    that               nà        那
    to be              shì       是
    tea                chá       茶
    rice/meal          fàn       饭
    cup                bēizi     杯子
    egg                jīdàn     鸡蛋
    question particle  mā        马
    no                 bù        不
    what               shénme    什么

Then you can talk about objects:

    This is tea.       Zhè shì chá。     这是茶。
    That is rice.      Nà shì fàn。      那是饭。
    This is a cup.     Zhè shì bēizi。   这是杯子。
    That is an egg.    Nà shì jīdàn。    那是鸡蛋。


Note: ‘Shì’ is ‘to be’. It is generally followed by a noun which defines the
subject/topic. It is not normally followed by an adjective on its own.

**How to form a question?**

A very simple way to form a question in Chinese is by putting a question
particle “ma” at the end of a sentence that would otherwise be a plain
statement. English counterparts of these questions are usually formed by
syntactically more complicated “transformational” processes such as movement of
the verb to the beginning of the sentence.


    Is  this  tea?      Zhè shì chá ma?   这是茶马？
    Yes./ No.           Shì / Bú  shì。   是/不是。

    Is  that  rice?     Nà  shì fàn ma?   那是放马？
    Yes.  /No.          Shì / Bú  shì。   是/不是。

    Is  this  a cup?    Zhè shì bēizi ma? 这是杯子马？
    Yes./No.            Shì / Bú  shì。   是/不是。

    Is  that  an  egg?  Nà  shì jīdàn ma? 那是鸡蛋吗？
    Yes.  /No.          Shì / Bú  shì。   是/不是。


Note: The word “bù” is the negative word. It precedes the verb to indicate that
something does not happen. Here its tone changes from the fourth to the second
because it is followed by a fourth tone. You will learn the rule in the future.

**So how do you ask what something is?**

‘什么 Shénme’ is the interrogative word “what.” The most important feature about
Chinese interrogative pronouns is that, unlike English practice, which shifts
all interrogative pronouns to the beginning of the question, Chinese keeps them
in the position in the sentence where the answers would be expected.



    What is this?   Zhè shì shénme? 这是什么？
    This is tea.    Zhè shì chá.    这是茶。
    What is that?   Nà shì shénme?  那是什么？
    That is a cup.  Nà shì bēizi.   那是杯子。
