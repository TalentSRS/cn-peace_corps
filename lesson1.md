Mandarin is the official language of the People’s Republic of China. It is the dialect spoken in the
capital, Beijing. It is taught in all schools and is used for television and broadcast. Almost the
entire population understands Mandarin. The language taught in Pre-Service Training (PST) for
Peace Corps trainees is Mandarin.

Chinese is a language with a large number of words with the same pronunciation but different
meanings; what distinguishes these ‘homophones’ is their ‘tonal’ quality – the raising and
lowering of pitch on certain syllables. Mandarin has four tones – high, rising, falling-rising and
falling, plus a fifth “neutral” tone. To illustrate, look at the word ma, which has four different
meanings according to tone:

| High           | mā | 'mother'              |
|----------------|----|-----------------------|
| Rising         | má | 'hemp' or 'numb'      |
| Falling-rising | mă | 'horse'               |
| Falling        | mà | 'to scold' or 'swear' |

## Writing System

Chinese is not a phonetic language and the characters do not bear any resemblance to actual
pronunciation. Chinese is often referred to as a language of pictographs.
There are about 56,000 characters, but the vast majority of these are archaic. It is commonly felt
that a well-educated, contemporary Chinese might know and use between 6,000 and 8,000
characters. To read a Chinese newspaper you need to know 2,000 to 3,000, but 1,200 to 1,500
would be enough to get the gist.

Each Chinese character represents a spoken syllable, so many people declare that Chinese is a
monosyllabic language. Actually, it’s more a case of having a monosyllabic writing system. While
the building block of the Chinese language is indeed the monosyllabic Chinese character,
Chinese words are usually a combination of two or more characters. You could think of Chinese
words as being compounds.

## Phonetic system – Pinyin

In 1958 China adopted a system of writing their language using the Roman alphabet. It's known
as Pinyin. It is used in this course.
Grammar

Chinese grammar is much simpler than that of European languages. There are no articles
(a/an/the), no tenses, and no plurals. The basic point to bear in mind is that, like English, Chinese
word order is subject-verb-object. In other words, a basic English sentence like “I (subject) love
(verb) you (object)” is constructed in exactly the same way in Chinese.
